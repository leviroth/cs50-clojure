A few [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) problem sets implemented in Clojure.

The focus here is on implementing the core algorithms and practicing Clojure. My
solutions do not necessarily implement the exact behavior specified in CS50's
problem sets.

## Installation

Download from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/leviroth/cs50-clojure.git

## Usage

    $ lein run-<problem-set> [args]

e.g.

    $ lein run-mario fancy

## Academic Honesty

CS50 is a course. Using these solutions as a basis for code that one submits for
credit probably
violates
[the course's policy on academic honesty](http://docs.cs50.net/2016/fall/syllabus/cs50.html#academic-honesty).
I am making these solutions public on the assumption that anyone capable of
understanding Clojure code and translating it to C is likely a relatively
experienced programmer, who therefore would have little trouble implementing the
introductory problem sets covered here on their own. If you fall into this
category, you have little to gain from cheating.
